The software and services delivered by the data management (DM) subsystem have a complex life cycle that requires concerted effort to maintain.
This paper describes the life cycle within DM through authoring, deployment, monitoring, to documentation.
Each of these aspects require specific tooling and services.
We describe in the following sections how code, tooling, and services work together in a coherent ecosystem to service the software quality and reliability engineering needs of the project.
